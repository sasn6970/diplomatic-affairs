This entry presents insights driven by SQL queries covering 239 states and their cities, along with the main languages spoken at each country. Improving awareness, recognition and support along cultures worldwide promotes understanding among individuals, rather than actual prevalence differences. The following project focuses on the relationships between three tables.

Since the focus of this stage is not visualization, it will not be accompanied by any sort of dashboard. Each query is meant to exemplify specific questions, which will be described in each relevant section, in order to show the context in which each provided insight may trigger data driven detition making. 

Because of the nature of demographic census (particulary at lower income economies, where data is scarcer), this information is to be taken as an estimate and one should remain cautious about using and interpreting this data beyond the scope of this project, which is only meant to demonstrate technical skill.

For replication purposes, the queries on diplimatic-affairs.sql can be applied and will return the expected output with the following relational dataset:
